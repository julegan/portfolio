# Event source review — October 17, 2026

**Review method: Julie approves additions through the pull request before publication. The associated PR records the current review state.**

The branch adds 69 dated occurrences to the 11-event prototype, for 80 total. New dates run October 18–December 13, 2026. All additions use venue or organizer pages. The original records and stable IDs are retained.

## Batch composition

| SHOWS category | Added occurrences |
| --- | ---: |
| Arts & DIY | 2 |
| Community | 1 |
| Markets | 36 |
| Music | 23 |
| Workshops | 7 |

## What was checked

- Title, published date, show time versus doors, venue, and stated age/cost information were read from the linked pages. New descriptions are brief paraphrases.
- `sources` preserves multiple references and original source categories separately from the SHOWS `category` and `tags`. An empty original-category list means the source did not supply a category; it is not an invented classification.
- Prices and accessibility claims are not inferred. `free: null` means admission was not confirmed; it does not assert that an event charges admission. These records do not enter the confirmed-free filter.
- Concert end times remain null. Calendar exports retain the existing clearly disclosed, editable one-hour placeholder.
- Addresses are venue or organizer locations in Portland. Area labels such as Hawthorne and Waterfront are browsing districts, not formal neighborhood-boundary determinations.
- Source checking is not a safety endorsement or a substitute for human editorial approval. This remains a manually maintained snapshot, with no cancellation-monitoring service.

## Recurring dates and exceptions

| Series | Included dates / rule | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PSU Farmers Market | 10-24, 10-31, 11-07, 11-14, 11-21, 11-28, 12-05, 12-12; 8:30 AM in October, 9 AM from November 7 | [Organizer](https://www.portlandfarmersmarket.org/our-markets/psu/) |
| King Farmers Market | 10-18, 10-25, 11-01, 11-08, 11-15, 11-22; season ends November 22 | [Organizer](https://www.portlandfarmersmarket.org/our-markets/king/) |
| Lents International Farmers Market | 10-18, 10-25, 11-01, 11-08, 11-15, 11-22; season ends November 22 | [Organizer](https://www.portlandfarmersmarket.org/our-markets/lents-international/) |
| Shemanski Park Farmers Market | 10-21, 10-28, 11-25; October 28 season end, then only the November 25 harvest date | [Organizer](https://www.portlandfarmersmarket.org/our-markets/shemanski-park/) |
| Portland Saturday Market | 10-24, 10-31, 11-07, 11-14, 11-21, 11-28, 12-05, 12-12; Saturdays only; no Sunday dates inferred | [Organizer](https://www.portlandsaturdaymarket.com/hours-and-directions) |

The Riso Basics dates are grouped as one workshop series. Crafty Wonderland has separate Friday, Saturday, and Sunday occurrences with their actual hours and admission types. Series exports contain only these checked dates, not an indefinite recurrence rule.

## Conflicts resolved / listings held back

- Crafty Wonderland: the organizer lists a 5 PM weekend close; Outlet’s participating-vendor listing says 6 PM. The records use the organizer’s 5 PM close and expose the difference in event details.
- PSU October 31: the general page says summer hours end October 30, but its dated October 31 listing explicitly states 8:30 AM–2 PM. The dated occurrence governs; both references are retained.
- SICK fundraiser at Dante’s: the structured listing says 9 PM show / 8 PM doors, while prose says 8 PM. Held back pending clarification.
- ADX “Sign Painting Workshop” overlaps the detailed Casual Practice lettering workshop with different hours. Only the specifically described Casual Practice event is added.
- HERE for PDX has a date/time but insufficient descriptive detail in the reviewed page. Held back instead of guessing its purpose.
- Star Theater and High Water Mark pages could not be read successfully; the Coffin Club page did not expose usable event detail. No listings were invented for those gaps.
- No newly verified Portland adoption or animal-welfare event is included in this batch. Oregon Humane’s dated October fundraiser is in Salem and is outside the current geography.
