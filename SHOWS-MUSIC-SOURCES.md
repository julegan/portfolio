# Original music priorities — source review, October 17, 2026

**Proposed additions: Julie reviews these through the pull request before publication.**

This pass adds **39 music dates: 37 live bills and two explicitly labeled goth DJ nights**, across nine places. The snapshot becomes 119 occurrences, including 65 music dates. No recurring market dates are added. Earlier events and stable IDs remain intact.

The research starts from the original underground metal, punk, goth, rock, hardcore, and DIY interests. [SHOWS-EDITORIAL.md](SHOWS-EDITORIAL.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) carry that priority into future work. Markets, learning, and community activities remain additional interests.

## Coverage

| Place | New dates |
| --- | ---: |
| AZØTH | 1 |
| High Limit Room | 3 |
| High Water Mark Lounge | 2 |
| Kenton Club | 1 |
| No Fun | 3 |
| Star Theater | 9 |
| The Coffin Club | 5 |
| Turn! Turn! Turn! | 6 |
| Twilight Cafe and Bar | 9 |

Music-style counts overlap on mixed bills; they are not separate event totals.

| Music style | New dates |
| --- | ---: |
| Goth & darkwave | 7 |
| Hardcore | 8 |
| Industrial & EBM | 9 |
| Metal | 7 |
| Noise & experimental | 2 |
| Post-punk | 4 |
| Punk | 17 |
| Rock | 8 |

## Verification and data handling

- Dated venue, promoter, official ticket, and artist pages verify the event year, date, location, and time. High Water Mark and Roman Candle ticket pages were available as indexed primary-source text while full pages blocked retrieval; that limit is recorded rather than attributed to an aggregator.
- Artist self-descriptions, artist-managed Bandcamp pages, labels, and venue descriptions support music styles. Styles are broad SHOWS browsing groups, separate from original source categories. Tags on a mixed bill may describe the identified headliner or support act; the evidence below names that basis.
- Two Church of Hive occurrences are DJ nights. Ritual Howls has live acts plus an included dance afterparty; it remains one event. No infinite weekly club recurrence is inferred.
- SPY/February and Sutekh Hexen publish doors only. `startTimeKind: "doors"` makes the time visibly say Doors; exports add `(doors)` to the event title and explain that performance start is unconfirmed. No secondary show time is substituted.
- All new end times remain unconfirmed. Existing exports use the disclosed editable one-hour placeholder. A venue curfew or calendar block is not a verified set finish.
- Missing prices use `free: null` and do not enter the confirmed-free filter. Missing event age restrictions remain unknown even when a venue has a general policy.
- AZØTH is listed by the promoter as Portland without a street address. No address is inferred and directions are not offered. High Limit access information comes from its own venue-info page.
- Shoot the Moon Fest groups only its four checked November 12–15 bills. The two checked Hive nights form a bounded series. Exports contain only those actual dates.

## Proposed dates

Times are Portland local time. Explicit offsets in `events.js` switch from PDT to PST on November 1.

## Existing bills made easier to find

Sixteen existing records receive evidence-backed style metadata and clearer subtitles; they are not added a second time. Earlier reviewed genre tags also map into the broad filters where the existing evidence supports a match.

## Held back and source gaps

- **Black Water / Habak, November 7:** Doomtown and another discovery calendar have a fitting bill, but direct venue, artist, or official ticket confirmation could not be obtained. Keep this as a review lead. The venue has moved; do not reuse its old Broadway address.
- **Black Water / Iron Lung:** the discovery guide gives an October 26 date with an incompatible weekday. No date is chosen from that conflict.
- **Coffin / Halloween Eve, October 30:** the ticket page gives doors after showtime and another description gives a different start. Held for timing clarification.
- **Coffin / Ayria, November 24:** ticket, artist, and support-act times differ. Held for clarification rather than treating the ticket field as an established performance time.
- **Star / Hive November 1 and 8:** the homepage dates conflict with linked detail pages showing July dates. Only October 18 and 25 are included.
- **Zanias, October 21:** the dated venue ticket and artist-managed event feed agree; a label page gives November 21. The included October entry exposes that conflict and does not create the unsupported second date.
- **Twilight / Atomic Rule:** advertised lineup/status requires current organizer confirmation. A stale venue listing alone is insufficient; no cancellation is asserted.
- **No Fun / November 13:** overlapping venue listings may represent a replacement; held until the venue clarifies. Void Lord December 11 remains a promising lead with event details but insufficient primary genre evidence.
- **High Water Mark:** two October bills have indexed primary ticket evidence, with explicit 8 PM doors / 8:30 PM show. Some aggregators say 7 PM; the entries follow the primary ticket provider. Later HWM coverage remains incomplete.
- **High Limit:** Oso Oso lacks a verified primary start time in the retrieved text; Big Ass Truck has conflicting secondary times and insufficient primary details. These are follow-up leads, not confirmed calendar entries.
- **Kenton:** one artist-confirmed October 24 bill is included. Other fitting venue listings lack an explicit year or time in accessible primary text.
- **Shanghai Tunnel and Soundcontrol:** readable direct inventory was insufficient. No events are invented to imply those sources are covered.
- **The Fixin’ To:** its current official show page says no events. Old listings are not treated as a current calendar.
- **Bossanova / Nova PDX:** no fitting live underground bill was verified in the checked calendar. Generic house/EDM is not used to fill the gap.
- Verified Halloween tribute bills and a few lower-priority indie leads remain outside this batch. The new listings emphasize original bills.

[SHOWS-EVENT-SOURCES.md](SHOWS-EVENT-SOURCES.md) preserves the earlier 69-occurrence expansion and its unresolved leads. This is a manually maintained snapshot, not a completeness claim or cancellation-monitoring service.
